        <p><span><b>Technology:</b> All of the conference can be accessed through this virtual website. The website mainly uses two external tools - Zoom and Rocket.Chat - all video sessions will use Zoom and text based interactions will be via Rocket.Chat. You do not need to register for these separately as the icml.cc login will let you use links to both of these tools automatically. Socials and some workshops will also be using Gather.town (which will also use your icml.cc credentials).
            </span></p>
        <p>Further details on this, and other aspects of the conference, will soon be available at the <a href="https://icml.cc/Conferences/2020/VirtualHelp">FAQ page</a>.
        </p>
        <p><b>Updated Privacy policy and Code of conduct:</b> The <a href="https://icml.cc/public/PrivacyPolicy">privacy policy</a> for ICML 2020 as well as the <a href="https://icml.cc/public/CodeOfConduct">code of conduct</a> have been updated to allow for the virtual platforms.

The specific changes in the privacy policy is that it now includes a statement (sharing section, third bullet) that we may share limited registration information with partner platforms to facilitate the virtual conference experience.
