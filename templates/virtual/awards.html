                                <strong>Abstract:</strong> Many applications
                                require optimizing an unknown, noisy function
                                that
                                is expensive to evaluate. We formalize this task
                                as
                                a multiarmed bandit problem, where the payoff
                                function is either sampled from a Gaussian
                                process
                                (GP) or has low RKHS norm. We resolve the
                                important
                                open problem of deriving regret bounds for this
                                setting, which imply novel convergence rates for
                                GP
                                optimization. We analyze GP-UCB, an intuitive
                                upper-confidence based algorithm, and bound its
                                cumulative regret in terms of maximal
                                information
                                gain, establishing a novel connection between GP
                                optimization and experimental design. Moreover,
                                by
                                bounding the latter in terms of operator
                                spectra, we
                                obtain explicit sublinear regret bounds for many
                                commonly used covariance functions. In some
                                important cases, our bounds have surprisingly
                                weak
                                dependence on the dimensionality. In our
                                experiments
                                on real sensor data, GP-UCB compares favorably
                                with
                                other heuristical GP optimization
                                approaches.

                                <p>"Bayesian optimization has become a powerful
                                    tool in many machine learning problems in
                                    the last
                                    10 years.... the mathematical technique used
                                    in the
                                    proof influenced subsequent research
                                    significantly."</p>

                                <p>"This is a nice, original analysis that has
                                    influenced many subsequent papers on GP
                                    bandit
                                    optimization and Bayesian optimization, and
                                    underlies the convergence analysis in very
                                    many
                                    Bayesian Optimization papers. Hence, it has
                                    become a
                                    well-known paper, which has had influence
                                    both in
                                    theory and practice, due to the ongoing
                                    practical
                                    impact of Bayesian Optimization for
                                    experimental

                                <p>"Bayesian optimization using Gaussian
                                    processes is an important technique for
                                    black-box
                                    hyperparameter tuning and autoML. However,
                                    there was
                                    no explicit finite sample convergence theory
                                    for
                                    this method. This paper treats Bayesian
                                    optimization
                                    as a bandit problem, and obtained a
                                    cumulative
                                    regret bound for GP-UCB in terms of the
                                    information
                                    gain. This leads to a first finite sample
                                    theoretical analysis for Bayesian
                                    optimization....
                                    it will have significant long term impact
                                    both
                                    theoretically and practically."</p>
